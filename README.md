# Generating by Prompts using SDXL-lightning

## Introduction

We create a module that generates images by user-defined (text) prompts. As a model, we utilize the pretrained version of [Stable Diffusion XL-lightning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13929) provided by [ByteDance at HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning).

## Setting Up the Environment
